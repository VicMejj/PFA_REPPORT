The ERP project developed for \textbf{Anter Lab} by \textit{Montassar Mejri} successfully integrates essential business processes into a unified backend system. The system offers modules for authentication, employee management, product and inventory tracking, sales (POS), and financial operations.

One of the major achievements of this project is the design and implementation of a complete \textbf{RESTful API backend} using \textbf{Laravel}, tested and documented with \textbf{Postman}, and secured with \textbf{JWT authentication}.

\textbf{Future perspectives} include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Completing and refining the frontend layer (Next.js or mobile app).
    \item Adding advanced accounting and CRM modules.
    \item Providing detailed dashboards and business intelligence analytics.
    \item Deploying the ERP with Docker and CI/CD pipelines for scalability.
\end{itemize}
