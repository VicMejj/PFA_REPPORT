\chapter*{Abstract}
This project presents the design and implementation of an \textbf{ERP system for Anter's Lab}, aiming to integrate core business processes such as human resources, inventory, point of sale (POS), and finance within a unified solution.

During this fully online internship, I served as the \textbf{backend developer}, responsible for the complete design and implementation of the API layer.  
The backend was developed as a set of \textbf{RESTful APIs} using the \textbf{Laravel framework}, secured with \textbf{JWT authentication}, backed by a relational database in \textbf{MySQL}, and thoroughly tested with \textbf{Postman}.

The development process followed the \textbf{Agile methodology} using the \textbf{Scrum framework}, organized into multiple sprints. \textbf{ClickUp} was employed for project management, task tracking, and sprint planning.  

All backend development was carried out in \textbf{Visual Studio Code}, with \textbf{GitLab} used for version control and team collaboration.  
This work demonstrates the importance of building secure, scalable, and modular backend systems for enterprise applications, providing a robust foundation for future web and mobile integrations.
