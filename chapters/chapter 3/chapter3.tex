\section*{Introduction}
This chapter presents the implementation of the ERP backend system carried out during the internship at Anter Lab. 
The work followed the Scrum methodology, divided into four weekly sprints due to the one-month duration of the internship. 
Each sprint focused on specific objectives: environment setup, core administrative APIs, configuration management, and reporting. 
In addition, we illustrate the design with UML diagrams (use case, class, sequence) and provide scenario tables for selected modules.

\section*{Conclusion}
The implementation phase transformed the specifications into a functional ERP backend system. 
Through iterative sprints, we ensured continuous progress and adaptability. 
This chapter showcased the environment setup, API development, configuration options, and reporting features, supported by UML diagrams and scenarios. 
The next chapter will evaluate the testing and validation of the developed system.
